We do not offer prorated refunds for any reason, including but not limited to partial usage of the service within the month. Once a payment is processed, you will have access to the service for the entire billing period.

Payment Errors:
In the event of a payment error, such as duplicate charges, please contact our customer support team immediately. While we maintain a no-refund policy, we will investigate and address any genuine errors to ensure fairness and transparency.

We reserve the right to modify or update this policy at any time, and any changes will be communicated through our official channels.
