        abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication
        preferences). Specific information about how we use such technologies
        and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.
        HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS? If you choose to register or log in
        to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to
        certain information about you. Our Services offer you the ability to
        register and log in using your third-party social media account details
        . Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
        information about you from your social media provider. The profile
        information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
        make public on such a social media platform. We will use the information
        we receive only for the purposes described in this privacy notice or
        that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please
        note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of
        your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We
        recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they
        collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set
        your privacy preferences on their sites and apps. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP
        YOUR INFORMATION? We keep your information for as long as necessary to
        fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise
        required by law. We will only keep your personal information for as long
        as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice,
        unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such
        as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this
        notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than
        the period of time in which users have an account with us. When we have
        no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
        information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
        this is not possible , we will securely store your personal information
        and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
        HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE? We aim to protect your personal
        information through a system of organizational and technical security
        measures. We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure. Thus, we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
        cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to
        defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify
        your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within
        a secure environment. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS? We do not
        knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
        years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least
        18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
        such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal
        information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
        will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we

        greater access to and control over your personal information. These
        rights may include: The right to request access and obtain a copy of
        your personal information. The right to request rectification or
        erasure. The right to restrict the processing of your personal
        information. The right to data portability . The right to object to the
        processing of your personal information in certain circumstances. If you
        have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may contact
        us. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES Most web browsers and some mobile
        operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track feature
        or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
        have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.
        At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
        implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
        currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
        automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
        standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
        future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
        this privacy notice. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE? Yes, we will
        update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws. We
        may update this privacy notice from time to time in response to changing
        legal, technical, or business developments. The updated version will be
        indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be
        effective as soon as it is accessible. We encourage you to review this
        privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your
        information. HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE? If you have
        questions or comments about this notice, you may email us at
        samvel.arakelyan00@gmail.com or by post to: HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE,
